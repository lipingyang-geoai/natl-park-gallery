## National Parks Map and Image Gallery

This application and the accompanying tutorial are a tribute to National Park Week (Apr 18-26).  We are using [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)

The first step is to download the [national parks boundaries dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-park-boundariesf0a4c). Then, load the shapefile into QGIS.
